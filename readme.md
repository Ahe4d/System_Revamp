# System_Revamp,
## For Blockland.


## What is System_Revamp?
### Basically, trying to "revamp" things that have already been done, or need to be added to make the game more user-friendly, smoother, and neater. These things include:

* Custom cursor chooser
* Smooth animations via console & admin gui
* Fixed things
    * and more!

### I will be updating this project daily, if you have any suggestions, or issues with System_Revamp please do tell via the pull request or issues tabs. Thanks!


## How do I download it?
### Simply click on the .zip to view it, and click "raw" or "view raw" to download the file as your own, seeing as github can't be asked to view the file for you.
