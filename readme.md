# System_Revamp,
## For Blockland.


## What is System_Revamp?
##### Basically, trying to "revamp" things that have already been done, or need to be added to make the game more user-friendly, smoother, and neater. These things include:

* Custom cursor chooser
* Smooth animations via console & admin gui
* Fixed things
    * and more!
