##Things you can do with System_Revamp
* A brand new chat! A chat you can use mentions, and chat coloring depends on who's admin/sa/regular/you
* Some new GUI things. With help from Zapk's Tango script, this is able to move GUIs on your screen and animate them.
* Mouse changing. Allows you to change your mouse cursor at any time, using the "Set Mouse Cursor" in the options menu.

___

* The new chat?
 - Mentions work very simply, you tag someone (such as @Anthonyrules144), and this tag will be re-colored, based on their administrative rank.
 - There will be customization for this chat in the future, as of now, you can change the size, but can't change the colors and so forth.
* GUI setup?
 - As of now, only certain GUIs are permitted to move about, and animate as such. In the future this will be changed, and more support will be added for developers using System_Revamp
* Mouse changing?
 - In the old System_Revamp code, after you changed your mouse, you had to reset your game, this was for good reason. In this version this has been fixed, and the mouse pointers work accordingly. You can find the option to change them in the Graphics menu of the Options GUI
